# Neural Image Caption Generation


# Introduction

A challenging artiﬁcial intelligence problem require to generate text descriptions from the given image data. it requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the ﬁeld of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order.
